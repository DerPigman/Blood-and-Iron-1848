 political.BaI.1.d:0 "'If we silence the voices of the people, how can any of us claim to be the voice of [Root.GetName] ourselves? If we fear dissent, if we fear being publicly denounced or ousted by public vote, what we truly fear is that we are hated and reviled by our own citizens. Does the [Root.GetRulingParty] really have so little confidence in its principles?'\n\nA careful and loosely organized, but passionate faction in the government has begun to push for less repressive policies against enemies of the state.

 political.BaI.3.d:0 "Relaxing the restrictions on what sort of anti-[Root.GetRulingParty] propaganda can be spread publicly has, predictably, lead to an increase in public expressions of dissent. Organized demonstrations and pamphlets are so far found mostly in academic institutions and some of [Root.GetName]'s more unfortunate areas, but there is little doubt that the movement is spreading.\n\nThe nation's leaders are torn over the issue. [Root.GetLeader], who maintains an iron grip on party leadership, has little desire to diversify public debate. The first steps have already been taken, however, and there may be no turning back."

The fact that even more people choose to identify themselves with a 'class' at all implies that Jacobinist ideas are spreading beyond those who actively seek to overthrow the government.\n\n[Root.GetRulingParty] members lament this development, longing for a time when '[Root.GetAdjective]' was what people identified as first and foremost. Their concerns are not unfounded. It could be argued that a revolution is already underway, occurring on several levels of society, and it may be too late to stop it."

 political.BaI.75.t:0 "Democratic Movement Goes Silent"
 political.BaI.75.d:0 "After a few months of loud opposition against [Root.GetLeader]'s regime, calling for public elections and more liberal laws on freedom of assembly and speech, the movement seems to have fallen apart. People now express more concern about the stability of [Root.GetName] if such reforms were to take place, with those who clamor for democracy being seen more as troublemakers than everything else.\n\nMore mysteriously, many of the leading figures of the movement appear to have gone missing or stopped their work suddenly. Perhaps some of them chose to go into exile when they saw the failure of their efforts. Regardless, the [Root.GetRulingParty] government denies all knowledge and involvement."
 political.BaI.75.a:0 "What a bunch of quitters."
